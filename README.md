# üîó SignalR-Connections

#### A project to illustrate and understand the connection lifetime events in SignalR.

This project calls out the connection lifetime events in a SignalR web application.  It can monitor the connect and disconnect
of each client.  A timer in the browser is utilized as well to disconnect the client.

## üìù TODO

* ‚¨ú Add **disconnect** button.
* ‚¨ú Use DI and IoC container for object creation.
* ‚¨ú Use a timing mechanism in the server to disconnect the client when their time has expired.
  * Might possibly send a warning versus just logging them out (much like a "server needs to reboot in 5 minutes")
* ‚¨ú Monitor reconnect events (only available in the .Net Framework)
* ‚¨ú Authenticate user **before** connecting to SignalR *(use token as unique key for client app)*
* ‚¨ú Move SignalR communication to license web service
* ‚¨ú Move SignalR to separate server (need Redis for scale out)
* ‚¨ú Publish to Azure
* ‚¨ú Publish to local HyperV VM *(test network connectivity - easy to turn OFF network)*
* ‚¨ú Wrap all of this up neatly into deliverables so web applications to **minimal** setup.
* ‚¨ú Convert web application to Angular
* ‚¨ú Test with Jasmine?
* ‚¨ú Convert web application to React

## üìÅ Folder Structure

* üìÅ **src/LicenseService** - A .Net Core 5 MVC web app & API to get and return licenses
* üìÅ **src/WebApplication1** - A .Net Core 5 MVC web app
* üìÅ **src/WebApplication2** - A .Net 4.8 MVC web app (coming soon)

There are slight differences between .Net Core and Framework SignalR libraries that are documented
[**here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/version-differences?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

## üî¢ Steps to Recreate the Project(s)

* Create a new .Net Core 5 web application.
* Add the SignalR client library using `npm` or `libMan`.
* Create a hub inheriting from the `Hub` base class.
* Configure SignalR in the Startup.cs file.
* Create an HTML view.
* Create the Javascript methods to create a hub on the client and process the messages.

## ‚úÖ Done!

* Steps to create the .Net Core 5 web application *(above)*
* Added messages for connect and disconnect
* Timer to warn user of inactivity *(user can cancel and reset the warning timer)*
* Timer for logout.
* Build license web service *(.Net Core 5.0)*

## ü§î Things to Consider

* [**Configuration**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/configuration?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=dotnet) - Timeouts, etc.
* [**Authentication and Authorization**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/authn-and-authz?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
* [**Host & Scale**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/scale?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
* [**Compare .Net Core & Framework API's / Features**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/version-differences?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
