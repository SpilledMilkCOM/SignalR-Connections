# 🔗 SignalR-Connections

#### A project to illustrate and understand the connection lifetime events in SignalR.

This project calls out the connection lifetime events in a SignalR web application.  It can monitor the connect and disconnect
of each client.  A timer in the browser is utilized as well to disconnect the client.

**📝 TODO**

* 🔳 Use a timing mechanism in the server to disconnect the client when their time has expired.
* 🔳 Monitor reconnect events (only available in the .Net Framework)

## 📁 Folder Structure

* 📁 **WebApplication1** - A .Net Core 5 MVC web app
* 📁 **WebApplication2** - A .Net 4.8 MVC web app (coming soon)

There are slight differences between .Net Core and Framework SignalR libraries that are documented
[**here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/version-differences?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

## 🔢 Steps to Recreate the Project(s)

* Create a new .Net Core 5 web application.
* Add the SignalR client library using `npm` or `libMan`.
* Create a hub inheriting from the `Hub` base class.
* Configure SignalR in the Startup.cs file.
* Create and HTML view.
* Create the Javascript methods to create a hub on the client and process the messages.

## 🤔 Things to Consider

* [**Configuration**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/configuration?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=dotnet) - Timeouts, etc.
* [**Authentication and Authorization**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/authn-and-authz?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
* [**Host & Scale**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/scale?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
* [**Compare .Net Core & Framework API's / Features**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/version-differences?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
